## TODO

* Upon user getting connection, they can enter 'connect' or exit
> connect triggers server to sends connected clients and their IPs

* tweak so server sends public keys, and all other details are forwarded from one client to another via the socket

* investigate usage on ncurses to split screen in two for client
> one side shows incoming messages (from other socket), one shows outgoing ones (from user)

* try to translate the c++ random functionality into c
