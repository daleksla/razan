> connect triggers server to sends connected clients and their IPs

* tweak so server sends public keys, and all other details are forwarded from one client to another via the socket

* find out how to read in from ncurses window and store in buffer, and to set a callback (if needed) when user hits enter (carriage return)

* try to translate the c++ random functionality into c
